# üëã Hi, I'm A. Akshara Reddy!

üéì I'm a final-year Engineering student with a passion for building smart, impactful solutions that blend **IoT**, **AI/ML**, and **full-stack development**. I enjoy working on projects that solve real-world problems‚Äîespecially in healthcare, industrial automation, and smart systems.

## What I'm exploring

- Machine Learning & AI  
- Full-Stack Development (Python, Streamlit, Java, SQL)  
- Internet of Things (IoT) ‚Äî Simulations & Hardware Projects  
- Data Analytics & Visualization  
- Health Tech & Smart Monitoring Systems

## Projects I worked on

- **Heart Disease Prediction App**  
  Built with XGBoost & Streamlit | CSV & real-time input 

- **IoT Smart Water Monitoring System**  
  ESP32 + sensors + mobile app for real-time quality monitoring and management

- **Gesture-Controlled Light System**  
  Tinkercad simulation controlling lights with finger movement

- **Anomaly Detection in IIoT Environments**  
  Machine learning models for predictive maintenance using industrial alarm data

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Languages: Python, Java, C  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib  
- IoT: ESP32, Arduino, Tinkercad, MQTT  
- Web: Streamlit, HTML/CSS, SQL  
- Others: Git, Firebase, REST APIs

## Currently Learning

- Full-stack IoT systems without hardware (simulated data + dashboards)  
- Building portfolio-ready ML apps with great UI/UX
